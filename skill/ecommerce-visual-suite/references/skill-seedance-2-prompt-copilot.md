# Seedance Prompt Copilot

## Purpose

This skill only writes creative prompt text for Seedance-oriented video
requests: user intent, reference roles, visible motion, timeline, sound,
continuity locks, and likely failure risks.

## Boundary With the available generation tools

`the available generation tools` owns runtime capability and execution checks. Do not decide or
promise available models, modes, durations, resolutions, parameters, reference
compatibility, prices, queue behavior, submission state, or success. For actual
canvas generation, use the `the available generation tools` skill as the source of truth to read
the current model catalog and generation workflow, resolve media refs, validate
the request, submit generation, and verify result state.

Keep the layers separate: this skill writes wording; `the available generation tools` reads current
options, handles refs, and runs generation. Never expose internal CLI or tool
names to users.

## Workflow

1. Identify direct canvas generation, reusable prompt, storyboard, reference
   plan, prompt rewrite, or failure diagnosis.
2. If generating on canvas, write one final structured prompt, then let the
   runtime workflow execute it. For direct generation, do not show a prompt
   draft, do not ask whether to submit, and do not mention `the available generation tools` in
   user-facing text.
3. Ask one compact question only when missing information blocks generation;
   otherwise proceed with a stated assumption.
4. Write the final generation prompt in the user's language, including visible
   section labels. If the user writes in Chinese, write the final prompt in
   Chinese unless they ask otherwise.
5. Always use a structured prompt body with section labels. Keep simple requests
   concise, but do not output an unstructured paragraph.
6. Include Reference roles when refs are present. Give each source one creative
   role, separate from execution refs. Use ordered placeholders such as
   `{{Image 1}}` only when they match execution order. For direct generation,
   keep the same structured prompt body and resolve and pass actual refs; do not
   collapse it into prose.
7. Include a Timeline or Action beats section for visible motion. Use timecodes
   when ordered beats, dialogue timing, transitions, music sync, or choreography
   matter.
8. Use `references/visual-elements.md` for camera, material, and beat wording.

## Output Contract

For prompt-only requests, return:

- Creative intent label in product terms, not runtime capability terms.
- Reference role summary and Reference roles section when refs are present.
- Structured prompt body with visible section labels.
- Timeline or Action beats section when motion matters.
- Final generation prompt in the user's language.
- Short avoid list focused on likely failures.
- One controlled retry variable.

For direct generation requests, do not expose this skill, file names, internal
refs, CLI commands, flags, raw payloads, or backend lifecycle details. After
`the available generation tools` verifies the real state, answer only in product terms.

For diagnosis, ask for the failed output if missing, then identify the visible
failure, likely prompt cause, smallest prompt change, preserve list, and one
controlled retry variable.

## Quality Bar

- Keep simple requests concise, but still structured.
- Put the intended outcome, subject, and primary action early.
- Prefer one visible action path over a crowded mini-film.
- Use timecodes only when they reduce ambiguity.
- For dialogue, state speaker, line, tone, pause, and visible reaction.
- Give every reference a clear visible role. Use full compatible reference
  coverage for every fact that must stay fixed, and keep its visual role
  separate from execution references; exclude only conflicting sources or true
  duplicates that add no visible evidence.
- Do not invent unseen reference details.
- Do not turn public claims into DirectorX runtime promises.
